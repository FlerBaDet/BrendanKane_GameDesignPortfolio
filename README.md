## Game Design Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio!
Here you can find my most recent digital games I have been working on
I have participated in multiple GMTK Game Jams using the Unity engine, and now I am developing Unity Games at Brock University.

## Latest Projects

### RedSpace (Demo)
#### Play as a Soviet Super Soldier and fight against enemies on the moon in this isometric shooter.

### Wizards of Erebor (Demo)
#### Play as a wizard in this dungeon crawler experience, cast magic that can bounce off walls, and be careful not to hit yourself! Fight enemies and find ladders to get deeper into the dungeon. This game contains a multiplayer demo that is partially working at the moment.

### Eurmainia: Death and Domain (Demo)
#### Explore a fantasy world, recruit troops, and make a name for yourself on the continent of Eurmainia.
