## Game Design Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! Here is all of my work from University and where my own personal projects can be found.
I have been making games since grade 9 in high school working from Batch to Turing and then on to Python.
In highschool I participated in multiple GMTK Game Jams using the Unity engine, and now I am devolping Unity Projects through my program at Brock University.
