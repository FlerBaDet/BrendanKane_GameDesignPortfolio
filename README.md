## Game Design Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! Here is all of my work from University and where my own personal projects can be found.
I have been making games since grade 9 in high school working from Batch to Turing and then on to Python.
In highschool I participated in multiple GMTK Game Jams using the Unity engine, and now I am devolping Unity Projects through my program at Brock University.

## University
This is a collection of my projects created while attending Brock University

### Year ~ 1
#### Tower of EreBor
Created with a team of 4 students including myself, all of the programming was done by myself.
All on the Godot Engine

#### Age of Quests: Forests of Aldeon
Created by myself using the Twine Engine. Some art assets are taken from the internet

### Year ~ 2
#### OEX
Created by myself, forced to use only primitive shapes in Unity to create an effective level that will guide the player and convey a story.

#### Klarisse's Keep
Created by myself on the Unity Engine, textures are taken from the internet.
In this project I learned how to design an environment, by working with Terrain, Trees, and Modeling. All modeling was done in 3DS Max. Most of the code was provided by Niagara College, I created some of my own scripts/adjusted scripts to make them work for my project.

## High School
### Grade 11
#### Celestial Space Academy
Created by myself on the CMU Academy website for one of my Computer Science class projects, the game does not contain its original audio due to issues with the original sources and updates done to CMU, so I do not claim any of the replacement audio for this game as my own. This was my favourite game that came out of high school and i had so much fun developing it over the course of a month. This game taught me a lot about programming standards and set me up for success in University.
